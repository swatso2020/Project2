# Name
What's Cookin'

## Description
Combining the power of TheMealDB API and a Sequelize database, What's Cookin' will allow users to search for recipes based on pre-defined categories, pull up a random recipe, save a recipe as a favorite, or write a review for a recipe.

### User Story
As a home cook, I would like to be able to search for new recipes and save the ones I really enjoy.
